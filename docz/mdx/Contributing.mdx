# Contribute

Contribution is really easy in the component library. There are just a few steps needed to start the project and adding new components or editing existing ones is a straight forward process.


## 1. Pull the project

```
git clone ssh://git@github.com:mazahir89/ace.git
```

and navigate to the project folder:

```
cd ace
```

## 2. Install dependencies

```
yarn install
```

## 3. Install lerna globally

```
yarn global add lerna
```

## 3. Bootstrap the project
This step will like all the inner dependencies(packages folder) with node_modules. This should be also run when you add a new component because it will need to be linked as well.

```
lerna bootstrap
```

## 4. Build all the component once

```
lerna run build:doc --stream
```

## 5. Start the development environment and the component you would like to edit
This step will like all the inner dependencies(packages folder) with node_modules. This should be also run when you add a new component because it will need to be linked as well.

*On Mac and Linux*
```
lerna run start --parallel --scope @ace/@(docz|component_name|SOME_OTHER COMPONENT)
```

*In Windows*:
```
lerna run start --parallel --scope @ace/docz --scope @ace/component_name
```

## 6. Create a documentation file
Create a new `COMPONENT.mdx` file in the `docz/mdx/Components` folder. You can check the existing once as well as read the documentation for [docz](https://www.docz.site/docs/introduction).

## 7. When done just push to a feature or fix branch and create a pull request!
Remember to commit with the semantic/conventional-changelog standard. If you don't husky(check root package.json) will not let you.

## Simple as can be!
