### `All style(React.CSSProperties) as props`

### **Important!**
Don't overuse this component. It is not designed 
for all-purpose use, because of the use of inline styles!
The rule of thumb is to use it when you have to create
a small adjustment to a text or align multiple components.
A good example of this is the [Lens](/lens) component,
where the details value at the bottom is a Box because
the text is bold!

<Playground>
  <Box
    color="orangered"
    backgroundColor="midnightblue"
    padding-left="24px"
  >
    I am a box!
  </Box>
</Playground>
